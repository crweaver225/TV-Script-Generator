# TV-Script-Generator

A recurrent neural network designed to generate tv scripts. This project uses python and tensorflow to train a recurrent neural network comprised of LSTM cells to generate a Simpsons tv script based off of Simpson tv script data. Recurrent neural networks are designed to take the context of previous output from the network into consideration for future output. This makes them ideal for natural language processing. More training is needed for this model to produce better results, but the short amount of training put into this model demonstrates its capacity to pick up on the nuances of human language in the form of script writting.
